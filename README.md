# Setup

The Dockerfile expects your local user to have uid 1000 and gid 1000. If they are different update the Dockerfile accordingly. 

Initial setup:
* mkdir -p tmp/bundle
* docker-compose up
* docker-compose exec web bundle --jobs=8
* docker-compose exec web rails db:setup

Then, for developing:
* docker-compose up
* docker-compose exec web rails s -b 0.0.0.0
* docker-compose exec web rails c

The website can be opened at http://localhost:3000. The docker-compose.yml is mounting your host folder in the container. So changes you make on the app will automatically be reflected in the container.


# Your tasks

#### 1. As a user I want to upload an excel file of barcodes in order to let the system know which barcodes have already been printed from another system

  * Implement new view/ form with one file input field and submit button (barcodes#import)
  * The uploaded excel contains the barcodes in the first column, one barcode per row. Skip the first row.
  * In case upload is missing or is not an excel file! highlight input and redirect to upload page
  * In case of any invalid barcodes (invalid ean8 or duplicate)
    * don't store anything in the database
    * display the error "Invalid barcodes found: xxx, xxx,  xxx, ..." (ex: "Invalid barcodes found: 4545455, 0235433.")
  * In case of only valid barcodes
    * redirect to root page
    * display notice "xxx barcodes imported!" (ex: "5 barcodes imported!")
  * The barcodes should have source "excel" in the database

#### 2. As a user I want to upload the raw excel we get from our partner in order to have less manual work for preparation
  * Enhance existing barcode upload from task one
  * If the barcode has more than 8 digits it's invalid
  * If the barcode has less than 8 digits
    * left pad with zeros to 8 digits and check if the barcode is a valid EAN8
      * if it's not a valid EAN8
        * left pad to only to 7 digits,
        * calculate the checksum and append it to the right

#### 3. As a user I want to generate a certain amount of barcodes manually in order to give the programmer some work
  * Add button "Generate new barcodes"
  * Clicking on the button
    * generates a random number (1 - 100) of new barcodes
    * displays a notice "xxx barcodes generated"
    * redirects to root
  * The generation should start with the lowest possible number and respect any existing barcodes in the database
    * example, dbs contains: 00000017, 000000024, 00000055
    * after generating 3 new barcodes, dbs contains: 00000017, 000000024, 00000031 (new), 00000048 (new), 00000055, 00000062 (new)
  * The barcodes should have source "generator" in the database


# Hints / rules

* Use can use the excel files in the doc folder for testing
* Use gems already present in Gemfile (ean8, rubyXL)
* See doc/code_snippets.rb for some hints (no need to use it)
* Use form and service objects where it makes sense
* Code should be clean, well structured and self-documentating (proper method naming, etc.)
* Write down in keywords what problems/ difficulties you faced
* Write down in keywords what could be improved/ refactored in your code
* Bonus points for: write some unit and controller specs for your tasks

Good luck and happy coding! :)

#### Difficulties: 
Getting the docker container running. specifically there were issues when connecting to postgres in the container as the default postgres user does not start with a password. I have now altered the db connection to send through a password.
* To solve run:
  * docker exec -it ocp_coding_challenge-master_db_1 /bin/bash
  * psql -U postgres
  * ALTER ROLE postgres WITH PASSWORD 'password';




#### Improvements: 
The is_ean8 validation could be pulled into a validation service instead of put directly in the model. The front end could get some styling. I could write some tests (If this were a production level app I would not dream of not writing tests, but I spent so long arguing with docker that I am over the 4 hour time limit)
